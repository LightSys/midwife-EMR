# Upgrade from 0.6.1 to 0.6.2

- Replaces the table used for sessions because the module managing sessions has
  changed from connect-mysql to express-mysql-sessions.

Connect-mysql was replaced by express-mysql-sessions at 0.6.0 but the table
replacement was inadvertently left undone in the create_tables.sql script and
the upgrade instructions. Fortunately, any installation using a mysql user with
create table permissions would have found that the upgrade went smoothly
nonetheless because a new **sessions** table would have been created and the
existing **session** (note the difference between singular and plural names)
table would have been left unused because the express-mysql-sessions module
takes care of that automatically.

This upgrade procedure merely cleans things up by dropping the unused session
table and including the definition of the sessions table in the
create_table.sql script. If the sessions table already exists as mentioned
above, then the create_table.sql script does not need to be run.

## Database Changes

```
DROP TABLE session;
```

Optionally and only if the sessions table does not already exist, run the following.

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sessions` (
  `session_id` VARCHAR(255) COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL,
  `expires` INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `data` text COLLATE utf8_bin,
  PRIMARY KEY (`session_id`)
) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
SHOW WARNINGS;
```
