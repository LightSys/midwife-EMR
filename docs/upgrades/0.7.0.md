# 0.7.0

### SQL changes

The user_role join table was eliminated because the application assumes that
there is a one to one relationship between a user and a role and therefore the
one to many capability allowed by the join table is not necessary. It just make
user/role maintenance more complicated.

**Perform a database backup before running this SQL.**

```
ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN role_id INT AFTER isCurrentTeacher;
ALTER TABLE user ADD FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES role (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION;

ALTER TABLE userLog ADD COLUMN role_id INT AFTER isCurrentTeacher;
ALTER TABLE userLog ADD FOREIGN KEY (role_id) REFERENCES role (id) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION;

UPDATE user u SET role_id = (SELECT role_id FROM user_role ur WHERE ur.user_id = u.id LIMIT 1);
UPDATE userLog u SET u.role_id = (SELECT ur.role_id FROM user_roleLog ur WHERE ur.user_id = u.id LIMIT 1);

DROP TABLE user_role;
DROP TABLE user_roleLog;
```

Source the ```database/sql/create_log_triggers.sql``` table in order
to recreate the triggers to match the changes to the schema structure.
