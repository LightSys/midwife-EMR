These are resources for one reason or another could not be sourced from an npm
module and are used in the build process to create the final javascript files.


## jQuery - Are You Sure - version 1.9.0

- [jQuery Are You Sure](jquery.are-you-sure )

There is not official npm package for this project, only a Bower package, but
we are not using bower anymore. The sole js file is placed here for processing
by gulp.

## Flot - version 0.8.3

- [Flot](https://github.com/flot/flot)

Again, there is only a bower package, no npm for this project.
