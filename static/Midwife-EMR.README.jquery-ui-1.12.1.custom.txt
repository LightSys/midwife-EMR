Created a custom version of jQueryUI with only a datepicker and the "humanity"
theme using the jQuery builder[1], which closely aligns with the theme I am
using for the medical portion of phase 2 written in Elm. The only widget
included is the datepicker and the core "jQuery 1.7 Support" option was
checked as well.

This is for the Elm client, which will call out to the datepicker via ports.
