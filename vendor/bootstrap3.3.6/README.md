# Flatly is a **Customized** Bootswatch theme

The Flatly theme from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) has been forked
[kbsymanz/bootswatch](https://github.com/kbsymanz/bootswatch) in order to
customize the settings for the kbsymanz/Midwife-EMR project.

```flatly/bootstrap.css``` and ```flatly/bootstrap.min.css``` are to be
acquired from kbsymanz/bootswatch within the Flatly theme.

The link to fonts (back to the Bootstrap installation) allows the use of a
modified bootstrap.css file from a themed version of the bootstrap.css file.
This is resolved by the the Webpack build process.
